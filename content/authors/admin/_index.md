I am excited to use technology to see plants and ecosystems beyond the human eye. Using remote sensing tools, I quantify and predict the terrestrial carbon cycle of California and I detect disease in strawberries.

I have had a very mixed research history that spans ecology, earth science and  agriculture. The underlying connections between these projects are a drive to solve complex problems using an interdisciplinary approach, my love for high-dimensional data and multivariate analysis, and a want to provide clear scientific advice to stakeholders and the general public.
